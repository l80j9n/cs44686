代做程序编程语言rst,   you    need   to   identify   the   items   that   should    be   measured   for   Groundworks   using   the   take-off   sheet, while   referring to the given   project drawings and ANZSMM.
•          Next, take-off quantities for those identified items using the measurement sheets, following   measurement   rules   in ANZSMM   and   referring to   project drawings and specifications.
•          Use query   sheet   to   mention   the   queries/assumptions   made   on   missing   details/   discrepancies.   In   the   query sheet,   both columns should   be filled. That   is the query   and   your   assumed   answer.
•          BOQ for   Preliminaries   and   Groundworks –   For   Groundworks   BOQ,   use   the   quantities   you   measured   in the measurement    sheets, also remember to add appropriate ‘preamble notes’    and      ‘trade   preliminary items’ before those measured items to make a complete   BOQ.   Preamble   notes and trade   preliminary   items are   listed at the   beginning of each ANZSMM section.   For   Preliminary   BOQ,   include   minimum 8 preliminaries that are applicable to the given   drawing.
